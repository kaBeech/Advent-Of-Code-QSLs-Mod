# To Do

## Update routes

- Write tests for routes

### Adjust http routes

- For example, get Day by route "/user/id:/game/:number/day/:number

## Update logic

- Allow Days/Parts to be completed before rolling mod, but do not award tokens in this case (also warn on frontend before completing unrolled Day/Part)
