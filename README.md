# Advent Of Code - QSL's Mod

This mod adds randomized challenge modifiers for the [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzle series. It will also track your progress

Each day you will get to roll for a randomized challenge modifier such as "Complete this puzzle in a language you've never used before" or "Complete this puzzle without reassigning any variables."

At the start of a new run you will be given seven re-roll tokens. You may use two of these tokens at any time before completing a challenge to re-roll one of your randomized modifiers

Certain modifiers may contain additions rolls that you may re-roll using one re-roll token

You are awarded an additional re-roll token whenever you are awarded a gold star in the main Advent Of Code game (i.e. two stars/tokens per day completed)

At any point you will be able to download your current progress sheet (to include in your git repository, hang on your fridge, etc.)

Have fun!
