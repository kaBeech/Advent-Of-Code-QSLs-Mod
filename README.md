# Advent Of Code - QSL's Mod
This mod adds randomized challenge modifiers for the [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzle series. It also tracks your progress

Each day you will get to roll for a randomized challenge modifier such as "Complete this puzzle in a language you've never used before" or "Complete this puzzle without reassigning any variables." 

At the start of a new run you will be given three re-roll tokens. You may use these tokens at any time before completing a challenge to re-roll one of your randomized modifiers. Use these tokens wisely and be aware that certain modifiers may contain additions rolls that you may re-roll

Upon completing a challenge you are awarded an additional re-roll token

At any point you will be able to download your current progress sheet (to include in your git repository, hang on your fridge, etc.)

Have fun!
