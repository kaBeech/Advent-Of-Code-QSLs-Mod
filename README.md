# Xtreme Xmas Code

Have you ever been savoring your [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) calendar, keyboard dusted with sugar cookie crumbles, reindeer curled at your feet, and found yourself wishing the puzzles were wilder? More challenging? MORE XTREME??

Well ho-ho-hold that thought because this is the mod for you!

[Xtreme Xmas Code](https://www.xtremexmascode.com) adds randomized challenge modifiers for the Advent Of Code puzzle series. It will also track your progress

Each day you will get to roll for a randomized challenge modifier such as "Complete this puzzle in a language you've never used before" or "Complete this puzzle without reassigning any variables."

At the start of a new run you will be given 24 re-roll tokens. You may use two of these tokens at any time before completing a challenge to re-roll one of your randomized modifiers

Certain modifiers may contain additions rolls that you may re-roll using one re-roll token

You are awarded an additional re-roll token whenever you are awarded a gold star in the main Advent Of Code game (i.e. two stars/tokens per day completed)

If you choose to make your game public, you will have access to a public link to share your game with others

Additionally, the mod scores each game based on how you use your reroll tokens and provides leaderboards for ranking games based on this score. I hope this will provide a brain-stretching leaderboard experience [that isn't tied to a strict time schedule](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/e2wjhf/comment/f90ksek/).

Have fun!
